# Contributing to Codeforces Quest

#### Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Codeforces Quest!  
#### Open source thrives because of passionate developers like you who help improve features, fix bugs, and enhance the overall experience for everyone. Whether you want to report an issue, suggest a new feature, or submit code changes, your contribution matters.

## Getting Started

#### Here‚Äôs how you can get involved and make your contribution count:

- **Explore Issues:** Find bugs or features labeled for contribution, or propose your own ideas by opening a new issue.

- **Fork & Branch:** Work from your own fork and create branches focused on specific features or fixes to keep your work organized.

- **Write Clean Code:** Follow existing coding styles and handle errors gracefully to ensure your code is robust and maintainable.

- **Commit Clearly:** Use meaningful commit messages that explain the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äù of your changes.

- **Submit Pull Requests:** When your changes are ready, submit a pull request with a clear description to help reviewers understand your contribution.

## Code Quality Guidelines

To maintain high code quality and consistency across the project, please adhere to the following guidelines:

### TypeScript Best Practices

- **No `any` types**: Always use specific type definitions or interfaces instead of `any`
- **Type safety**: Ensure all function parameters and return values have proper types
- **Interface definitions**: Create interfaces for complex objects and API responses
- **Type imports**: Import types from the central `types.d.ts` file

### Logging Standards

- **Use the logger utility**: Never use raw `console.log()` statements
- **Import the logger**: `import { logger } from '@/utils/logger'`
- **Log levels**:
  - `logger.log()` - General information (disabled in production)
  - `logger.info()` - Important information (disabled in production)
  - `logger.warn()` - Warnings (disabled in production)
  - `logger.error()` - Errors (always logged, even in production)
  - `logger.debug()` - Debug information (disabled in production)

### Testing Requirements

- **Write tests**: All new features and bug fixes should include tests
- **Test location**: Place tests in `__tests__` folders next to the code they test
- **Test naming**: Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- **Run tests locally**: Always run `npm test` before submitting a PR

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
npm test

# Run tests once (recommended before PR)
npm run test:run

# Run tests with UI for debugging
npm run test:ui

# Generate coverage reports
npm run test:coverage
```

### Linting and Type Checking

Before submitting your code:

```bash
# Run the linter
npm run lint

# Check TypeScript types
npx tsc --noEmit

# Build the project
npm run build
```

All three commands should complete without errors before you submit a PR.
