## 3. Dark Theme

![Dark Theme Support](/public/assets/images/preview3.png)

#### Codeforces Lite offers a highly optimized dark theme designed to provide a more visually comfortable experience, especially during extended coding sessions. The dark theme ensures a consistent look throughout the entire platform.

#### Key features of the dark theme include:

- **Eye Comfort:** The dark theme reduces eye strain by minimizing the contrast between the screen and the environment, particularly in low-light conditions.
- **Battery Efficiency:** On devices with OLED or AMOLED screens, the dark theme can help conserve battery life by reducing the energy used to display brighter pixels.
- **Code Readability:** Syntax highlighting is optimized for better readability in dark mode, ensuring that different elements in the codeâ€”such as keywords, variables, and commentsâ€”stand out clearly without causing visual fatigue.
- **User Control:** You can toggle the dark theme on or off based on your preferences, allowing you to switch between light and dark modes seamlessly.


## 4. Custom Templates and Default Cursor Placement

#### With Codeforces Lite, you can set up custom templates that automatically load whenever you start solving a new problem. This feature helps you avoid the repetitive task of setting up your environment or writing boilerplate code from scratch.

#### By predefining your commonly used template (such as input/output functions, imports, or debugging statements), you can focus directly on problem-solving, improving your speed and efficiency during contests or practice sessions.

#### Additionally, you can specify the exact position for your cursor using the `$0` symbol in your template, allowing you to start typing right where you need. The extension also remembers the cursorâ€™s position when switching tabs and revisiting problems, ensuring you pick up exactly where you left offâ€”saving valuable time during contests.

## 5. UI Enhancements

![UI Enhancements](/public/assets/images/preview4.png)

#### Codeforces Lite enhances the overall UI of Codeforces by making it more accessible, visually appealing, and user-friendly.

#### Elements are optimized for better positioning, creating a clean and intuitive interface for seamless navigation.

- Improved alignment of the problemset page for a more structured look.
- Redesigned login and register pages for a smoother user experience.
- Customized dark theme for various extension components to ensure consistency with our dark theme design.
- **User Control:** You can easily toggle the `Change UI` option on or off according to your preferences, allowing you to switch seamlessly between the default user interface and the enhanced version.
